# IITB-CISC-CPU

This was done as a course project in EE224 (Digital Design). The objective was to design a 8 register, 16 bit CISC computing system that can perform simple arithemetic computations. The project was done in VHDL language using Intel Quartus IDE and 
simulations using ModelSim Altera. A small python script was written to convert human friendy assembly language to machine understanble binary instructions.

The iitb-cisc-cpu folder contains all the project files. The IITB_CISC_CPU.pdf is the problem statement. The final report submission is also present in the repo.
